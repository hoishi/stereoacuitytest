# stereoacuitytest
Experiment
PsyExp.m is a main function of stereoacuity test.
usage: PsyExp('PROTOCOL','NAME')
PROTOCOL requires to input the name of a .prtc file in the protocol folder.
NAME is participant's name.
e.g. PsyExp('StereoTestHaplo151201-4pos-DL','HO')
PsyExp.m loads env.mat which is a information about the environment of the experiment set.
You can replace env.mat in the degugenv folder, if you check the stimuli.

I have not finished writing the descriptions yet.
